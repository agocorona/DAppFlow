Write Plutus smart contracts and DApps as continuous workflows.
===============================================================

Problem statement
-----------------

DApp developpers maintainers and verifiers face the "endpoint hell" in Web, in chain and in out-chain code


Summary of the solution to the problem
---------------------------------------

- Express the entire program flow within a Haskell monad which set HTTP endpoints for microservices and uses Plutus endpoints.
- DApps involving contracts take a long time to complete. some intended or unintended shutdowns of the application may happen. The program support stop and recovery of the execution state at the step where it was when it was stopped. 


The monad will execute as off-chain Haskell code. It will be a continuous `do` expression that will define HTTP endpoints and will use Cardano endpoints. The result is a clear specification of the entire process as a "workflow" which is clearly readable, maintainable and verifiable.

Example
-------

 A person would describe the game as "first someone lock some amount and a key, then  any other could guess that key and receive the money. That sequentiality is expressend in  `gameSequence` below where `lock` and `guess` are.. humm.., in sequence:

```haskell
main = keep $
  initNode $ do
    initHandlers

    getWallet

    gameSequence <|> published "guess" <|> balances 
    return ()

  where
    getWallet = do
      POSTData (wallet :: WalletId) <- minput "wallet" ("enter your wallet number" :: String)
      localIO $ print ("WALLET", wallet)
      local $ setSessionState $ Wallet wallet

    gameSequence = do
      POSTData (amo :: Int, word :: String, hint :: String) <- minput "lock" ("enter lock amount, the key and a hint. Example: 100 myKey \"word of 5 letters\"" :: String)
      cid <- pabLock amo word

      i <- local genPersistId
      guessw :: String <- public "guess" $ minput ("guess" <> show i) ("guess " <> hint)
      localIO $ print guessw
      pabGuess word guessw

    pabLock amo word= local $ do
      wallet <- getSessionState
      runPAB $ do
        cid <- activateContract wallet Lock
        callEndpointOnInstance cid "lock" LockParams {secretWord = word, amount = Ada.adaValueOf $ fromIntegral amo} -- ,lockIndex=0}
        return cid

    pabGuess word guessw =  do
      local $ do
        wallet <- getSessionState
        liftIO $ print ("wallet", wallet)
        runPAB $ do
          cid <- activateContract wallet Guess
          callEndpointOnInstance cid "guess" GuessParams {guessWord = guessw} --,guessIndex=0}
      minput "" (if word == guessw then "YES" else "NO" :: String)

    balances = do
      minput "bal" ("wallet data" :: String) :: Cloud ()
      Wallet walletid <- local $ getSessionState <|> error "no wallet?"
      snap <- getWalletUtxoSnapshot walletid
      minput "" snap :: Cloud ()
      empty

    initHandlers= local $ do
          handlers <- testnetHandlers
          initPAB handlers
```

After locking a number, the same user can guess his own lock. That is nice but it is not a multiuser workflow where any other user can guees the other's lock. That is the role of `public`  and `published` which add the guess link to a list and exposes all the guess links to other users who entered in the application and created locks.  

this line...

```haskell
 guessw <- public "guess" $ minput "guess" ("guess a lock for " ++ hint) 
```

..means: show a guess link to the user that sent the lock, but at the same time before that user respond, add this guess link to the options that every other user get once he enter his wallet.

So we have a multinuser workflow in which one user locks and every other can guess. 

Naturally,  by changing having different identifiers for `public` and `published` you can program more personalized options.

Note that we donÂ´t have to store the variables like the word to gues etc in a off-chain session state, since they are local variables in the monad. In general, there is no need to manage database objects. It is stored with the state of the program, which can be stored in IPFS registers.This simplifies the development. 

As a detail, in guess, now there are two wallets involved in the lock-guess game: the one of the locker and the one of the guesser. the first can be retrived with `getState`; the second with `getSessionState`. The second gives the data of the user who executed a te previous `minput`.


An example interaction of this second snippet is:

```
option: start
hostname of this node. (Must be reachable, default:localhost)? "localhost"
if you want to retry with port+1 when the port is busy, write 'retry': 
port to listen? 8000
Connected to port: "8000"
Enter  id               to: enter your wallet number       url:    http://localhost:8000/2/20002000/0/0/1/$int

```
In another console:

```


curl 'http://localhost:8000/2/20002000/0/0/1'
[{ "msg"=enter lock amount, the key and a hint. Example: 100/myKey/\"number between 0..1000\""
, "url"="http://localhost:8000/23/40002000/0/0/$int/$int/String"}

# curl 'http://localhost:8000/7/40002000/0/0/100/42/"number between 0..1000"'
[{ "msg"="guess number between 0..1000", "url"="http://localhost:8000/17/70002000/0/0/$int"}]
```
Enter another wallet number

```
curl 'http://localhost:8000/2/20002000/0/0/1/2/'
[{ "msg"="enter a lock number", "url"="http://localhost:8000/19/40002000/0/0/$int"}
,{ "msg"=""guess number between 0..1000", "cont"=http://localhost:8000/17/70002000/0/0/$int}]
```

Now "juan", besided starting a new game, has received one more option above: to guess the number entered by the first wallet. $int means a number which is the key entered previously (42).

```
# curl 'http://localhost:8000/9/70002000/0/0/42/'
[{ "msg"="YES", "url"="http://localhost:8000/21/110002000/0/0/"}]

```
He entered 42 and yes that was the number. The on-chain code will reflect it in the balances.

The on-chain code is not shown here, but it is identical of the one of the  plutus canonical game example with the addition 
of a index to allow differnt games at the same time. See [guessGameIndexed.hs](https://github.com/agocorona/DAppFlow/blob/main/ContractExample/GuessGameIndexed.hs) and compare it with [guessGame.hs](https://github.com/agocorona/DAppFlow/blob/main/ContractExample/GuessGame.hs)

Status
======

Currently this is under development ad I can not write a recipe for easy compilationand excecution of the examples
